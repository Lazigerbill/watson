Since we spoke to you on our last call, we continued to execute on our strategic plan. In my remarks today, I'll take some time to reflect on some of the strides we have made in strengthening our balance sheet and reshaping our portfolio. Overall, we are pleased with our progress, and I would like to thank my teammates for their many contributions. We have more work to do, which is an opportunity for us and for our shareholders. On the capital side, we completed a $117 million equity offering in August. The proceeds from this offering will help fund our growth through the three developments and the building expansion we started in the third quarter. They will also keep our leverage at the low end of our target range of 6.5 times debt-to-EBITDA. We also closed on the $100.6 million 10-year 4.03% secured financing that we told you about on our last call. This financing effectively funds in advance the higher cost debt we plan to repay in the fourth quarter and throughout 2013, and provides additional proceeds for growth. We would like thank our banking and lending partners for their continued support in executing these transactions. On the portfolio side, we made significant progress on our sales of nonstrategic assets, or as we like to call it, improving our portfolio through addition by subtraction. We completed $56.5 million of sales during the quarter, bringing our total for 2012 to $80.4 million. The largest sale in the quarter was our Columbus, Ohio portfolio for $39 million. We also sold our land parcel in that market for $5.3 million. As we discussed on past calls, Columbus has been a difficult market for us. We expect rent growth for that market to be below average as the supply and demand fundamentals will remain challenging there for the foreseeable future. As a group, these assets also significantly lag our overall portfolio in terms of functionality. Our total sales proceeds for the portfolio and land combined exceeded our written down book value by about $6.6 million, or about 18%. During the quarter we sold seven additional buildings for $12.2 million, or approximately 36% above our written-down basis. I'd like to recap what we've accomplished in our portfolio improvement efforts since the fourth quarter of 2010, from both a sales and investment perspective. Since that time we have sold 6.9 million square feet and four land parcels for a total of $175 million. The sales prices we have achieved exceeded our written-down book value on these assets by 35%. The sales cap rate was 6.4%, including land. Excluding land, the cap rate was 7.7%. On the investment side during the same time frame, we completed and committed to a total of more than $200 million of new investments comprised of $52 million through two acquisitions, totaling 1.1 million square feet in Houston and central Pennsylvania; $36 million through our 692,000 square foot First Inland Logistics Center development in Southern California that we leased during the quarter; and the $115 million we will invest through the development and building expansion we talked about on our last call, namely, First Bandini Logistics Center, a 489,000 square foot distribution center in LA County, First Chino Logistics Center, a 300,000 square foot building in the West Inland Empire, First Logistics Center at I-83, a 708,000 square foot distribution center in central Pennsylvania, and the 156,000 square foot building expansion in Minneapolis. We continue to look for additional investment and development opportunities that will deliver sustainable cash flow, meet our return criteria, and help in our mission to upgrade our portfolio. While we are pleased with this progress, it is also important to note that the investment market, particularly for the type of assets we are focused on, remains very competitive. We will maintain our discipline on pricing so our main avenue for growth and new investments may continue to be development and value-add acquisition opportunities using our platform. Turning now to leasing. We finished the quarter with occupancy at 88.5%, up from 87.9% as of the second quarter, and 86.6% a year ago. Sales accounted for 80 basis points of the gain quarter-over-quarter, so the rest of our portfolio was down 20 basis points. When we spoke to you last time, we talked about the summer lull we were experiencing. For us, that lull continued throughout much of the quarter, so our average occupancy was less than we expected, which will also impact our fourth quarter. Scott will walk you through the details. Leasing activity picked up late in the third quarter and has continued in the fourth quarter across a range of tenants and industries, although decision-making remains measured. Activity doesn't pay the bills, so our job is to convert this activity into signed leases. For the quarter, we delivered good growth in same store cash NOI, which was positive 4.3% excluding termination fees. We also made further headway on our top 10 vacancies from our Investor Day last November. As of the end of the third quarter, these properties represented 830 square feet of occupancy opportunity, or 130 basis points on our current portfolio base, compared to 325 basis points at investor day. We still have short-term leases in place at some of these properties so we can generate additional cash flow by stabilizing them with long-term leases. Leasing is at the heart of our plan to drive value from our existing buildings and our new development, and our team is focused on those opportunities. With that, let me turn it over to Scott. Scott? Thanks, Scott. Before we open it up to questions, let me just say that we have been working over the past few years to reposition our balance sheet and our portfolio and improve our cash flow. We are making good progress with our new developments, which represent $115 million of quality investments, and we are out seeking additional opportunities that meet our criteria. We have been reshaping our portfolio through our disciplined sales process. Our balance sheet is in good shape, and we will continue to look for ways to further strengthen it and lower our capital costs. We can grow cash flow through leasing, both from our existing assets and our new developments. We do all of these levers as great opportunities for our Company and for our shareholders, and as a team we are focused on continuing to execute and enhance shareholder value. Finally, becoming a dividend-paying REIT remains a key goal for our Company. We have reached a number of milestones to that end, but as we previously noted, more leasing is essential to recommending the reinstatement to our board. Our team is comprised of many shareholders who also look forward to return of the dividend. So, we are all focused on improving occupancy and cash flow. We will now be happy to take your questions. As a courtesy to our other callers, we ask that you limit your question to one plus a follow-up, in order to give other participants a chance to get their questions answered. You are most welcome to get back into the queue. And so, now, Operator, may we open it up for questions?"}, "commit"=>"Go Analyse"}

Since we spoke to you on our last call, we continued to execute on our strategic plan. In my remarks today, I'll take some time to reflect on some of the strides we have made in strengthening our balance sheet and reshaping our portfolio. Overall, we are pleased with our progress, and I would like to thank my teammates for their many contributions. We have more work to do, which is an opportunity for us and for our shareholders. On the capital side, we completed a $117 million equity offering in August. The proceeds from this offering will help fund our growth through the three developments and the building expansion we started in the third quarter. They will also keep our leverage at the low end of our target range of 6.5 times debt-to-EBITDA. We also closed on the $100.6 million 10-year 4.03% secured financing that we told you about on our last call. This financing effectively funds in advance the higher cost debt we plan to repay in the fourth quarter and throughout 2013, and provides additional proceeds for growth. We would like thank our banking and lending partners for their continued support in executing these transactions. On the portfolio side, we made significant progress on our sales of nonstrategic assets, or as we like to call it, improving our portfolio through addition by subtraction. We completed $56.5 million of sales during the quarter, bringing our total for 2012 to $80.4 million. The largest sale in the quarter was our Columbus, Ohio portfolio for $39 million. We also sold our land parcel in that market for $5.3 million. As we discussed on past calls, Columbus has been a difficult market for us. We expect rent growth for that market to be below average as the supply and demand fundamentals will remain challenging there for the foreseeable future. As a group, these assets also significantly lag our overall portfolio in terms of functionality. Our total sales proceeds for the portfolio and land combined exceeded our written down book value by about $6.6 million, or about 18%. During the quarter we sold seven additional buildings for $12.2 million, or approximately 36% above our written-down basis. I'd like to recap what we've accomplished in our portfolio improvement efforts since the fourth quarter of 2010, from both a sales and investment perspective. Since that time we have sold 6.9 million square feet and four land parcels for a total of $175 million. The sales prices we have achieved exceeded our written-down book value on these assets by 35%. The sales cap rate was 6.4%, including land. Excluding land, the cap rate was 7.7%. On the investment side during the same time frame, we completed and committed to a total of more than $200 million of new investments comprised of $52 million through two acquisitions, totaling 1.1 million square feet in Houston and central Pennsylvania; $36 million through our 692,000 square foot First Inland Logistics Center development in Southern California that we leased during the quarter; and the $115 million we will invest through the development and building expansion we talked about on our last call, namely, First Bandini Logistics Center, a 489,000 square foot distribution center in LA County, First Chino Logistics Center, a 300,000 square foot building in the West Inland Empire, First Logistics Center at I-83, a 708,000 square foot distribution center in central Pennsylvania, and the 156,000 square foot building expansion in Minneapolis. We continue to look for additional investment and development opportunities that will deliver sustainable cash flow, meet our return criteria, and help in our mission to upgrade our portfolio. While we are pleased with this progress, it is also important to note that the investment market, particularly for the type of assets we are focused on, remains very competitive. We will maintain our discipline on pricing so our main avenue for growth and new investments may continue to be development and value-add acquisition opportunities using our platform. Turning now to leasing. We finished the quarter with occupancy at 88.5%, up from 87.9% as of the second quarter, and 86.6% a year ago. Sales accounted for 80 basis points of the gain quarter-over-quarter, so the rest of our portfolio was down 20 basis points. When we spoke to you last time, we talked about the summer lull we were experiencing. For us, that lull continued throughout much of the quarter, so our average occupancy was less than we expected, which will also impact our fourth quarter. Scott will walk you through the details. Leasing activity picked up late in the third quarter and has continued in the fourth quarter across a range of tenants and industries, although decision-making remains measured. Activity doesn't pay the bills, so our job is to convert this activity into signed leases. For the quarter, we delivered good growth in same store cash NOI, which was positive 4.3% excluding termination fees. We also made further headway on our top 10 vacancies from our Investor Day last November. As of the end of the third quarter, these properties represented 830 square feet of occupancy opportunity, or 130 basis points on our current portfolio base, compared to 325 basis points at investor day. We still have short-term leases in place at some of these properties so we can generate additional cash flow by stabilizing them with long-term leases. Leasing is at the heart of our plan to drive value from our existing buildings and our new development, and our team is focused on those opportunities. With that, let me turn it over to Scott. Scott? Thanks, Scott. Before we open it up to questions, let me just say that we have been working over the past few years to reposition our balance sheet and our portfolio and improve our cash flow. We are making good progress with our new developments, which represent $115 million of quality investments, and we are out seeking additional opportunities that meet our criteria. We have been reshaping our portfolio through our disciplined sales process. Our balance sheet is in good shape, and we will continue to look for ways to further strengthen it and lower our capital costs. We can grow cash flow through leasing, both from our existing assets and our new developments. We do all of these levers as great opportunities for our Company and for our shareholders, and as a team we are focused on continuing to execute and enhance shareholder value. Finally, becoming a dividend-paying REIT remains a key goal for our Company. We have reached a number of milestones to that end, but as we previously noted, more leasing is essential to recommending the reinstatement to our board. Our team is comprised of many shareholders who also look forward to return of the dividend. So, we are all focused on improving occupancy and cash flow. We will now be happy to take your questions. As a courtesy to our other callers, we ask that you limit your question to one plus a follow-up, in order to give other participants a chance to get their questions answered. You are most welcome to get back into the queue. And so, now, Operator, may we open it up for questions?"}, "commit"=>"Capture"}

Welcome to the Red Robin Gourmet Burgers third-quarter 2012 conference call. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the lines will be open for your questions following the presentation. As a reminder, part of today's discussion will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These statements are commonly identified by words such as continue, plan, expect, will, and other terms with similar meaning. These statements will include, but will not be limited to, statements that reflect the Company's current expectations with respect to the financial condition of the Company; results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business, including the Company's traffic and revenue driving initiatives; intentions with respect to expense management and plans for deployment of capital; and other expectations discussed during the course of this call. Although the Company believes the assumptions upon which preliminary or initial results, financial information, and forward-looking statements are based are reasonable as of today's date, these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and, therefore, investors should not place undue reliance on them. Also, these statements are based on facts known and expected as of the date of this conference call and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements to reflect events or circumstances that might arise after this call. Participants on the call today should refer to the Company's Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of the risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could impact the Company's future operating results and financial condition. The Company has posted its fiscal third-quarter 2012 press release and supplemental financial information related to the quarter's results on its website, www.RedRobin.com, in the Investors section. I want out turn the call over to Mr. Steve Carley, Chief Executive Officer of Red Robin."}, "commit"=>"Capture"}

Earnings Conference Call", "date"=>"October 29, 2012 / 02:00PM  GMT ", "speaker"=>"Denny Post,  Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. - SVP & Chief Marketing Officer", "wcount"=>"776", "transcript"=>"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As you know from tracking Black Box and other industry sources, traffic has been hard to come by this year and particularly in the last quarter. That is why I am so proud of the way that the menu and marketing teams continue to come together to outperform competitors today and to set us up for even further and stronger growth in the future. A key focus area continues to be delivering innovative flavor combinations that make us gourmet at an everyday value to our guests. Our Tavern Double platform, which we launched in the second quarter and more recently used to create news through new Tavern styles and The Big Tavern, continues to meet our expectations. This platform now accounts for a significant mix and has emerged as the most successful new platform launch in our history. During the third quarter we featured the Tavern Double on TV to reinforce everyday $6.99 with bottomless fries value, while also bringing back the popular Oktoberfest Burger, supported with online and social media as well as strong in-store merchandising. The best part, this one-two combination allowed us to sell the Oktoberfest at full price this year rather than taking the $3 discount we did last fall. This top-line/bottom-line balance worked well to drive profitable results as you will see when Stuart takes you through the details. We are also having greater success with menu options that help build average check. Along with the Oktoberfest burger LTO, we introduced warm pretzel bites, a great new shareable appetizer that generated incremental sales. Other check drivers included our bar business, frequent trade up to Tavern styles, and featuring a popular entree, in this case our hand-battered, made-to-order Arctic cod fish and chips. Another key part of our marketing strategy is becoming even better at engaging guests through our Red Royalty program. During the third quarter we leveraged Red Royalty to drive repeat, profitable traffic. One of our successes was an offer that offset traffic softness during the Olympics. We are using Red Royalty for micromarketing in key geographies to generate awareness of new menu items and to segment our guests with smart rewards. Membership has reached 1.9 million guests, and while it is already an effective and profitable program for us, we continue to refine it and link it with other engagement tools such as e-blast and social media for even greater impact. During the third quarter we also made further progress against our bar and beverage initiatives. Take Back the Bar initiatives continued to increase our alcohol beverage mix, up to 7.2% as of Q3 this year. Taking Back the Bar is also about differentiating our brand, being more relevant to adult guests and creating a great dining experience in our bar. The addition of a master mixologist to our culinary team has already generated benefits in the form of improved core beverage items, greater variety of both alcohol and non-alcohol beverages, and offerings that set us apart such as our Sam Adams Oktoberfest Beer Shake. The beer shake story was picked up by national outlets ranging from The Today Show to CNBC and in many markets across the country. This fun new item really captured people's imagination. It generated more PR impressions in a month than we achieved for legacy programs in an entire year. It was unexpected and it spoke to the whimsical nature of our brand. Looking ahead we still have a lot more opportunity to increase beverage mix, and we are confident we have a slew of strong concepts in the pipeline. As Steve is fond of saying, this is a marathon, not a sprint. And while we are pleased with our progress so far, we know we have a long runway ahead to become best-in-class. Last, on the advertising front we will have a new agency partner in place by year-end with the experience and the media leverage we need to go to the next level. Those are just a few of the headlines from Q3 on the menu and marketing front. With an unprecedented investment in quantitative, qualitative, and sensory research we are developing a robust pipeline of new products, evaluating new kitchen equipment to expand our capabilities, and breaking new ground in marketing. We have multiple market tests in place this fall, all supported by operations and other teams across the enterprise partnership, for which I am very grateful. We are just starting to rock 'n roll. Now I am going to turn the call over to Stuart to give you more perspective on our operating results and the outlook for the rest of the year. Stuart?"}, "commit"=>"Capture"}
