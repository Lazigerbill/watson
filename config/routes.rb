  # The priority is based upon order of creation: first created -> highest priority.
  # See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes".

  # You can have the root of your site routed with "root"
  root 'entries#landing'

  # Example of regular route:
  #   get 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'
  post 'entries/upload' => 'entries#upload'
  post 'entries/:id/analyse' => 'entries#analyse', as: :analyse
  post 'entries/analyse_all' => 'entries#analyse_all', as: :analyse_all
  post 'entries/:id/export_csv' => 'entries#export_csv', as: :export_csv

  post 'entries/linkedin' => 'entries#linkedin'
  # Example of named route that can be invoked with purchase_url(id: product.id)
  #   get 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', as: :purchase

  # Example resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
  resources :entries
  resources :user_sessions
  resources :users

  get 'login' => 'user_sessions#new', :as => :login
  post 'logout' => 'user_sessions#destroy', :as => :logout

  # Example resource route with options:
  #   resources :products do
  #     member do
  #       get 'short'
  #       post 'toggle'
  #     end
  #
  #     collection do
  #       get 'sold'
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments, :sales
  #     resource :seller
  #   end

  # Example resource route with more complex sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments
  #     resources :sales do
  #       get 'recent', on: :collection
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with concerns:
  #   concern :toggleable do
  #     post 'toggle'
  #   end
  #   resources :posts, concerns: :toggleable
  #   resources :photos, concerns: :toggleable

  # Example resource route within a namespace:
  #   namespace :admin do
  #     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
  #     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
  #     resources :products
  #   end
end
