Notes:
1. Add user activation to ensure no dummy accounts
2. User model add created at, updated at
3. First day 3 users completed all 50 companies, should we add more work per user? (Ling said no, rather students focus more on the writing)
4. Check and see if Hobby dyno is sufficient (more than enough for 40 students)
5. Check and see if Hobby Postgres is sufficient (more than enough for 40 students)
